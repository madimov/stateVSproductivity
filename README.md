# stateVSproductivity

A tool for automated collection and analysis of state and productivity data.

Read about the initial project on [Medium](https://medium.com/@MikoDimov/state-and-productivity-d0a5a30d0d80). 

I am in the process of converting this from a highly personalized project to a smoother, more general-use tool for time management and habit optimization.

To run the current prototype, run the "run_SVP.py" script and follow the instructions.

An early visualization from a month-long experiment tracking state data:

The variables I tracked included mood, exercise, wake-up time, bedtime, sleep duration, sleep quality, time spent in bed not sleeping, and productivity.

One of the challenges in automating this is accessing data from sleep and productivity apps, some of which don't have API's set up.
